<span style="border: 1px dotted; font-size: 125%; font-weight: bold; color: silver;">Run-in
Elements</span> Another  interesting  block/inline hybrid is the value 
<code>run-in</code>,  introduced in CSS2, which has the ability to take block-level 
elements  and make them an inline part of a following element.  This is useful for 
certain  heading effects that are quite common in print typography, where a heading 
will  appear as part of a paragraph of text.
